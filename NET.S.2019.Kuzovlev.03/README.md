Tasks:
1. The greatest common divisor calculations.

- Implement a class that allows to perform GCD calculations using the Euclidean algorithm for two or more integers
Euclidean algorithm (EN)
GCD computation algorithms (RUS)
- In addition, this method should determine the value of the time required to perform the calculations.
- Add method that implements the Stein's algorithm (binary Euclidean algorithm) to calculate the GCD of two or more integers.
The method also should determine the time required to perform the calculations.

- Add unit tests.

2. Double to binary string

- Implement the extension method to get a string binary representation of a real double-precision number in IEEE 754 format.
- Add unit tests.
