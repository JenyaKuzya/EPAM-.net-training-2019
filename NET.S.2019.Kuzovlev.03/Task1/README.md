Implement a class that allows to perform GCD calculations using the Euclidean algorithm for two or more integers

In addition, this method should determine the value of the time required to perform the calculations.
Add method that implements the Stein's algorithm (binary Euclidean algorithm) to calculate the GCD of two or more integers.
The method also should determine the time required to perform the calculations.

Add unit tests.
