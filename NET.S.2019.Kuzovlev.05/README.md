Tasks:
1. Polynomial class.
Implement an immutable Polynomial class for working with polynomials from one variable (use the sz-array as the internal structure for storing coefficients).

For developed class

- override the virtual methods of the Object class;
- overload operations allowed for working with polynomials (except the division of a polynomial by a polynomial), including == and !=.
Add unit tests.

2. Bubble sort for jagged arrays
Implement a bubble sort algorithm for jagged integer arrays (do not use sorting methods of the System.Array class), so that it would be possible to order the rows of the matrix:

- in ascending (descending) order by sum of matrix row elements;
- in ascending (descending) order of maximum elements of matrix rows;
- in ascending (descending) order of minimum elements of matrix rows;
Add unit tests.
