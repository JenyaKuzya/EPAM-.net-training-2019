Implement a bubble sort algorithm for jagged integer arrays (do not use sorting methods of the System.Array class), so that it would be possible to order the rows of the matrix:

in ascending (descending) order by sum of matrix row elements;
in ascending (descending) order of maximum elements of matrix rows;
in ascending (descending) order of minimum elements of matrix rows;
Add unit tests.
