Implement an immutable Polynomial class for working with polynomials from one variable (use the sz-array as the internal structure for storing coefficients).

For developed class 
- override the virtual methods of the Object class;
- overload operations allowed for working with polynomials (except the division of a polynomial by a polynomial), including == and !=.
- Add unit tests.
