Create generic classes for representing square, symmetric and diagonal matrices (a symmetric matrix is ??a square matrix that matches a transposed matrix; a diagonal matrix is ??a square matrix whose elements outside the main diagonal certainly have element type default values). Implement in the created classes an event that occurs when the matrix element with indices (i, j) changes. Extend the functionality of the existing class hierarchy by adding the ability to add two matrices of any type. Add unit tests.
