Implement the InsertNumber method which gets two integer numbers and two positions of bits i and j (i <j). The algorithm inserts bits of one number into another so that the bits of the second number take positions from bit j to bit i (bits are numbered from right to left). Add NUnit and (!) MS Unit Test to test the method.
